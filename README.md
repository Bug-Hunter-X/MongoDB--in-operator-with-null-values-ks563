# MongoDB $in operator with null values
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when dealing with null values.  The `$in` operator, when used with an array containing `null`, might not produce the expected results.

## Problem
The `$in` operator is intended to match documents where a field's value exists within a specified array. However, if this array includes `null` values, the query behavior becomes inconsistent and may lead to unexpected outcomes. 

## Solution
Instead of directly including null in the $in array, handle null values separately using the $or operator or by checking for null explicitly.
